        <p><b>What is the physical internet?</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>The internet is often imagined as weightless and immaterial, but every digital connection is anchored in a
            vast physical infrastructure. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p> Data travels through sprawling data centers, carried by underground
            transmission lines, powered by massive electrical facilities, and relayed across oceans through subsea
            cables that stretch for thousands of miles. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Cell towers punctuate skylines, translating signals between
            devices and networks, while server farms hum quietly on the outskirts of cities, consuming enormous amounts
            of energy to keep information flowing. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>This physical internet reveals that our digital world is not detached
            from the material one, it is deeply rooted in landscapes of steel, concrete, and wire.</p>
